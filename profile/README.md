# Cavern Newsletter - 9/21/2022
Hello everybody! This is the official daily Cavern Newsletter. We have officially gone public on twitter; https://twitter.com/caverngg. 
You may have noticed that we have our website domain up everywhere; https://cavern.gg. The website is not public yet and is currently
down for active development and it will be down a lot, as a result this github page is the only place to get consistent and verified
information on the development and status of Cavern! To answer a few questions I have recieved emails about, no this is not similar
or a copy of discord. Yes, the UI is similar. However, we are VERY different as we have a strict no censorship policy which means
our platform is open to everybody no matter where you are and what you do. Cavern is still very very early in development and
is subject to change. To anybody wondering where the source code is; it is currently not public due to security reasons.
Feel free to reach out to me personally if you have any questions. P.S. Cavern is completely free and has no extra charges 
what so ever, Cavern is a non-profit service.
